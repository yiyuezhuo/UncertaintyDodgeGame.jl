# A dodge game with partial-observable obstacles

In this game, you dodge obstacles which is not always observable as usual game. You should control your radar to get noisy observation at some time and work with result of [Kalman Filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalman_filter) at most of time. Since exact dodging become impossible, collision would not end game or decrease HP, but just increase a hit count and give you a immunity time period. Your goal is to find a solid policy to minimize your expected collision count.

## Run the game

```shell
julia Game.jl
```

## Illustrations

Red points are noisy observations location, 8 points are used to portray the contour of the 1Ïƒ area of the Kalman Filter. So it's possible the target is outside of the area due to properties of Kalman Filter (probability or "failure" to handle big scale maneuver).

## Formulations

The state of a obstacle is denoted by a 6-vector $X = (p_x, v_x, a_x, p_y, v_y, a_v)$ (position, velocity and acceleration of $x$ and $y$). The movement are driven by a random initial speed and a random "force" (the the acceleration follow a Wiener process).

State transition model (matrix):

$$
F_1 = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & \Delta t & \Delta t^2/2 \\
0 & 1 & \Delta t \\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
$$

$$
F = \begin{bmatrix}
F_1 & 0 \\ 
0 & F_1
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Process noise:
$$
Q_1 =
\begin{bmatrix}
\Delta t^2 / 2 & \Delta t & 1
\end{bmatrix}'
$$

$$
Q = \begin{bmatrix}
Q_1 Q_1' & 0 \\
0 & Q_1 Q_1'
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Observation model:

$$
H = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Observation noise:

$$
R = \begin{bmatrix}
\sigma^2_{px} & 0 \\
0 & \sigma^2_{py}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

The calculation call [KalmanFilter.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGNSS/KalmanFilters.jl) to do the work.

## Notes

The game is based on [Starlight.jl](https://github.com/jhigginbotham64/Starlight.jl) engine and committed to a Julia game jam in the [Julia Discord's game-dev channel](https://discord.com/channels/762167454973296644/775962287461629952).
